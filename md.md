\section{Variability and Consistency Issues}

The experimental results reveal significant variability and consistency issues across different Knowledge Graph (KG) completeness levels. This section analyzes the high standard deviations observed in the performance metrics, discusses the sensitivity to initial conditions and environment configurations, and explores the implications for model generalization and robustness.

\subsection{Analysis of High Standard Deviations Across Metrics}

The summary statistics reveal substantial variability in all performance metrics across KG completeness levels:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:} Standard deviations range from 3.88 (50\% KG) to 13.15 (100\% KG), with the highest variability at full KG completeness. This indicates that performance becomes more unpredictable as more information is available.
    
    \item \textbf{Gap:} The standard deviations are particularly high, ranging from 25.58 (100\% KG) to 145.22 (75\% KG). The extreme variability at 75\% KG completeness suggests a critical point where additional information may lead to highly inconsistent performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Improvement:} Standard deviations vary from 0.17 (75\% KG) to 0.75 (50\% KG), indicating considerable inconsistency in learning progress across different runs.
\end{itemize}

These high standard deviations suggest that the agent's performance is highly variable and inconsistent, regardless of the level of KG completeness.

\subsection{Discussion on Sensitivity to Initial Conditions or Environment Configurations}

The wide range of performance metrics observed in the concise_df.csv data suggests high sensitivity to initial conditions and environment configurations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Extreme Outliers:} We observe instances of exceptionally high efficiency (e.g., 66.67\% at 100\% KG) and extremely large gaps (e.g., 548.75 at 75\% KG). These outliers indicate that certain initial conditions or environment configurations can lead to dramatically different outcomes.
    
    \item \textbf{Inconsistent Trends:} The best and worst performances do not consistently align with specific KG completeness levels. For example, the highest efficiency (66.67\%) occurs at 100\% KG, but so does one of the lowest (1.06\%). This suggests that factors beyond KG completeness significantly influence performance.
    
    \item \textbf{Variable Learning Progress:} Improvement values range from highly negative (-0.99) to positive (2.90), indicating that the agent's ability to learn and improve varies greatly across different runs, possibly due to differences in initial states or environment layouts.
\end{itemize}

This sensitivity implies that the agent's performance is heavily influenced by the specific configuration of each run, rather than being consistently determined by the level of KG completeness.

\subsection{Implications for Model Generalization and Robustness}

The observed variability and consistency issues have several implications for the model's generalization capabilities and overall robustness:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Limited Generalization:} The high variability in performance metrics suggests that the model struggles to generalize across different environment configurations. This implies that strategies learned in one scenario may not transfer effectively to others, even with similar levels of KG completeness.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Robustness:} The presence of extreme outliers and the inconsistent relationship between KG completeness and performance indicate a lack of robustness in the model. A truly robust model should demonstrate more consistent performance across various initial conditions and environment layouts.
    
    \item \textbf{Overfitting to Specific Configurations:} The wide range of performance metrics suggests that the model may be overfitting to particular environment configurations rather than learning generalizable strategies. This is particularly evident in the cases where performance at higher KG completeness levels is worse than at lower levels.
    
    \item \textbf{Challenges in Reliable Deployment:} The inconsistency in performance makes it difficult to predict how the agent will behave in new, unseen environments. This unpredictability poses challenges for reliable deployment in real-world scenarios or more complex game environments.
    
    \item \textbf{Need for Improved Stability:} The high variability across all metrics highlights the need for techniques to improve the stability of the learning process. This could involve methods such as experience replay, more sophisticated exploration strategies, or meta-learning approaches to better handle diverse environments.
\end{itemize}

These implications underscore the challenges in developing reinforcement learning agents that can effectively utilize knowledge graph information across a wide range of scenarios. Future work should focus on improving the model's ability to extract generalizable patterns from the KG, developing more robust learning algorithms that are less sensitive to initial conditions, and implementing techniques to stabilize performance across diverse environment configurations.
